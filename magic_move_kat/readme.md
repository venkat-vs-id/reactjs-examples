React Magic Move is a great component given by Ryan Florence( https://github.com/ryanflorence/react-magic-move). 

However when I tried to implement it it was not working in React version 15.x. Some of the functions used in that code were deprecated and were throwing error. So I thought I will fix that and here is the revised working code.

This is not a Production module, its just a fun experiment I used to understand and play with ReactJS.

Have a look at this blog for some steps to implement and screenshots of how the examples look like.
